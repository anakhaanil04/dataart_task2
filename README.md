This project  shows the timeline of evolution of mobile phones. so far i have completed the phase 1 that consists of only html. I used tags like article, figure, main, header tags etc.
I made css for a responsive layout. I added styling to header and added css to the whole page. The design adapts at break points, mobile, tablet and desktop.
